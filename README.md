# Lecture 2
## Scope
### The scope is the current context of execution in which values and expressionsare "visible" or can be referenced. If a variable or expression is not in the currentscope, it will not be available for use. Scopes can also be layered in a hierarchy, so that child scopes have access to parent scopes, but not vice versa.
### we have 4 types of Scope
### 1 Globale scope is a scope that is used globaly
### 2 Function scope is only used inside the Function
### 3 Blocck scope is used inside loop and and for if 
### 4 mudle scope is used for making sevral js files and conecting them in one and we cant use same varaible names 
## reminder let and const is local but var is globaly 
## hoisting
### hoisting in js is puting consol log before its varaible like calling somebefore even nameing it !
### we can use hoisting in Function they work 100% 
### hoisting in var is undefined  
### hoisting in let and const is  tecnically yes but not in practice  or oder name TDZ
